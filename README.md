# TITANIC-DATA-SCALING

ðŸš¢ Titanic Data Scaling A preprocessing notebook that applies and compares various feature scaling techniques on 
the Titanic dataset. Includes Min-Max, Standard, Robust, and Quantile transformations to assess their 
impact on model performance. Ideal for understanding how scaling affects classical machine learning algorithms.
